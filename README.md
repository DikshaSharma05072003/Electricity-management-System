# Electricity-management-System

The "Electricity Bill System" is a Java-based project that allows users to managetheir electricity consumption bills, and payments.
The system offers both consumer and admin functionalities. Consumers canview their monthly bills, pending payments, make payments, and check theirmeter readings. Admins can add new consumers, update meter readings, viewconsumer details, and manage billing records.
The project showcases object-oriented programming, data handling, and userinput validation.
It demonstrates my ability to design and implement a practical utility that canefficiently manage electricity billing information.
